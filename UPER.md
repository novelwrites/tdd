<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

- U = "Understand"
- P = "Plan"
- E = "Execute"
- R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
*After reading the preamble, I believe the problem has multiple components:
A. The need to represent my personal commitment to code excellence in order to 
be able to contribute to forwarding TEKsystem's mission of providing quality products 
which reflect industry best engineering practices in object-oriented design.
B. Use this exercise as a learning experience, utilizing the concepts we have been taught 
about duringTEKcamp to both process and solidify learning and to challenge myself
to extend that learning through research and collaboration.
C. Meet the assignment requirements:
1. Follow the Git Instructions provided.
2. A simple console application in which the coding exercise is entirely my own code.
3. The code must be written in an IDE (I chose intelliJ).
4. Source code is to be submitted without its byte code.
5. The application takes the inputs provided which consist of a variety of products, determines
which products are taxable or must have an import duty added. Upon purchasing the 
products a receipt is created that lists the name of each product, the price and any applicable taxes and/or import duties for each item, with rounding rules applied correctly.
D. An important aspect to be held in consideration during the coding process is to focus on code quality by making the code easy to read and maintain, adhering to OOD patterns and principles (SOLID) (Expandable Design) and implementing unit testing (TDD). 
E. Challenges:
1. How can I complete this assignment successfully with my current skill and experience level?
2. How can I implement the core requirements into my application?
3. How can I prioritize my time so that I can maximize my productivity while meeting my other commitments?
4. Where do I get the information I will need to complete the assignment?
5. It’s not just about me – How can I help my teammates to be successful?

<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
1, Review Assignment requirements so that I understand what I need to research and learn in order to be able to meet them.
2. Review OOP and OOD concepts (continual process) and strive for a mindset that incorporates those principles when coding.
3. Watch the videos we have been assigned in order to be able to implement TDD.
4. Identify resources available for gaining the knowledge necessary for the task.
5. Complete Step One and Two of UPER so that the problem is understood and a plan is in place to execute a solution.
6. Write pseudocode to clarify the task. Begin coding basic structure. Identify problem areas and prioritize time according to what can be accomplished while waiting on resources needed to accomplish tasks in the queue. Keep in mind OOD and OOP principles. Write tests and implement TDD unit testing as part of the coding process. Push to GitHub frequently.
7. Be an encouragement to those around me.
8. Address and Resolve any Coding Issues. Complete Documentation. Do final push to GitHub.

    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>
I got off to an extremely shaky start. As a java newbie, it has been very challenging these last couple of weeks researching and learning the information I needed for my capstone. I was blessed with help from a friend who patiently answered all of my questions, provided great explanations, and guided me as I worked on the code. I did not want to take up any more of his time so I decided that I would watch the video tutorials and attempt to learn what I needed to complete this assignment without help. I had struggled during our morning sessions understanding how to implement TDD because I had no previous exposure to it and it is difficult learning so much information in such a short period of time. I find that the impromptu Webex sessions by TEKcamp faculty are very helpful for many of the other students (and are very appreciated) but are often over my head and so it is more beneficial for me to find other resources for help. 

My determination to learn TDD on my own did not end well. All of the videos I watched used Eclipse and my IDE is intelliJ. I found them very confusing. I did not want to have to learn a new IDE when I already have so much to learn for the assignment. I wasted an entire day (well, not wasted - like Benjamin Franklin said: "I didn't fail the test, I just found 100 ways to do it wrong"). That said, I reached out to a great group of guys (fellow students) that I affectionately call the Avengers after the team of Marvel superheroes. We spent many hours collaborating today (Saturday July 18) and I am now begin to understand and implement TDD in my own code. This is a journey that I will be continuing in the morning. As I always like to say, "MY SOLUTION TO CODING AND EVERYTHING IN LIFE: You don’t need to know everything, you just need to know how to find out what you need to know..."

I have most of my classes created and I have successfully written my first junit tests and created code to begin meeting the assignment requirements. I have completed several TDD cycles of fail-pass-refactor and pushed several times to GitHub to show my work. I am very grateful for the guidance I have received and I am looking forward to learning more and to keep working on my code. It's after midnight and I want to code a little more before I go to bed - I'll update after my Sunday session with the Avengers :)

<h2>
    4. Reflection / Refactor
</h2>
*In  reflection, I find that while I am too new to coding to meet the goals of this assignment on a professional level, I do have the heart and desire to do my best, to continue to learn, and to continue to grow. I come from a test engineering background in the semiconductor industry and while an electronics test engineer and an IT test engineer are quite different - I find that we both share a passion for testing. I am very excited about TDD and will strive to continue learning and growing in these areas - quality code enhances the quality of life for our customers and that is always something very worthwhile to strive for in any endeavor!

After the collaboration session I participated in on July 18, I posted this in Slack:
I am feeling so torn right now. I just read the news about the spread of the virus today and I feel sick at my stomach as to how it is affecting our world. But I literally just got out of a collaboration session with @Matthew Choat @Zach and @John Bozarov who joined together to help me understand and begin to implement TDD in my code. I am so grateful for the lights in a world so filled with darkness. Let's continue to be lights for one another, not just in TEKcamp, but in the world. If we all do that, the darkness will not prevail. Matthew, Zach, John - Thanks for lighting my world today!

More later :)
